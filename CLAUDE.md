# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository purpose

**IP+MP Platform** — internal pipeline for Expande Digital Consultores SpA and Sociedad de Inversiones Dreamoms SpA. It sequences *Research → Production → Packaging → Export* of journalistic/communication assets (reports, columns, legislative briefs, white papers, etc.) with AI assistance. All user-facing copy is Spanish (Chile/Uruguay).

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Next.js dev server (http://localhost:3000)
npm run build    # Production build — run BEFORE every push (see workflow below)
npm run start    # Run production build locally
npm run lint     # ESLint (eslint-config-next)
```

There is no test runner configured.

### One-time DB bootstrap (idempotent)

After the first deploy to Vercel, create tables and seed 7 tenants + 13 templates:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://<app>.vercel.app/api/admin/init?token=$ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

`POST /api/admin/init` is gated by the `ADMIN_TOKEN` env var and can be re-run safely (`onConflictDoNothing` on slug).

### Required environment variables

- `DATABASE_URL` — Railway Postgres public URL
- `ADMIN_TOKEN` — long random string, protects `/api/admin/*`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — required for any `/api/ai/*` call

## Architecture

### The IP→MP phase split (the one concept you must understand)

The pipeline has **two phases** gated by a "traspaso" (handoff) event. Most of the recent refactors (see commits `e34b2a0`, `6a75f52`) exist to enforce this split:

1. **InvestigaPress (IP) phase** — pure journalism, no brand context.
   - Pipeline statuses: `draft`, `validacion`, `pesquisa`.
   - A `project` is created with only `title` + `thesis`. `tenantId`, `templateId`, and `brandVariant` are **nullable** and start null.
   - `publicId` is temporary: `IP-<year>-<NNNN>`.
   - `classification` defaults to `'por_asignar'`.
   - AI calls use `IP_PROMPT_BUILDERS` from `src/lib/ai/prompts.ts` — no tenant/template context is injected into the system prompt. Consumption is logged against the `investigapress` tenant.

2. **MetricPress (MP) phase** — branded production.
   - Pipeline statuses: `produccion`, `visual`, `revision`, `aprobado`, `exportado`.
   - The handoff happens via `PATCH /api/projects/[id]` with `tenantSlug` + `templateSlug` (and optional `brandVariant`). This:
     - Resolves and sets `tenantId`/`templateId`.
     - Copies `template.defaultClassification` into the project.
     - **Regenerates `publicId`** from `IP-YYYY-NNNN` to `TENANT-PREFIX-YYYY-NNNN` (e.g. `DREAMOMS-RP-2026-0001`).
   - **Hard block** in `PATCH /api/projects/[id]`: advancing status from `pesquisa` → `produccion` fails with `code: 'TRASPASO_REQUIRED'` unless both `tenantId` and `templateId` are set. Do not remove or weaken this gate.
   - AI calls use `MP_PROMPT_BUILDERS`, which layer brand-specific instructions on top of the IP prompt.

The pipeline order is defined once in `src/app/api/projects/[id]/route.ts` as `PIPELINE_ORDER` and consumed by both GET (for `pipelineIndex`) and PATCH (for `advance`/`retreat`). The project's response adds a derived `phase: 'investigapress' | 'metricpress'` based on current status.

### AI layer (`src/lib/ai/`)

- `provider.ts` — **code must never import `@anthropic-ai/sdk` directly**. All model calls go through `generate({ system, userMessage, ... })`, which returns `{ text, model, usage, durationMs }`. This is an intentional abstraction so the underlying provider can be swapped. Default model is `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`; pricing table lives in the same file.
- `prompts.ts` — holds the two parallel registries `IP_PROMPT_BUILDERS` (no args) and `MP_PROMPT_BUILDERS` (requires `TenantContext` + `TemplateContext`). Current tools: `generador_angulos`, `validador_tono`, `constructor_pitch`. When adding a new tool, add it to both registries and update the `ToolName` union + `VALID_TOOLS` array in `src/app/api/ai/generate/route.ts`.
- `usage-tracker.ts` — `trackUsage()` writes to `consumption_logs`. It is intentionally fire-and-forget: errors are swallowed so tracking never breaks the primary response. Preserve that behavior.
- The prompts themselves (including the "5 lentes de noticiabilidad" methodology and JSON output contracts) are **intellectual property of Expande Digital Consultores SpA**. Do not paste them into external systems or public issues.

### `/api/ai/generate` contract

- Body: `{ tool, userMessage, tenantSlug?, templateSlug?, projectId? }`. Both tenant and template slugs are optional — presence of both switches to MetricPress mode, otherwise InvestigaPress mode runs and consumption is logged against the `investigapress` tenant.
- Responses are expected to be JSON, but models sometimes wrap output in markdown fences or prose. The route has a **three-step robust parser** (direct → strip ``` fences → extract first balanced `{...}`/`[...]`). If parsing fails, the response still succeeds with `result` as the raw string and `parseError` set, plus `rawText` truncated to 2000 chars. Preserve this fallback chain; clients depend on always getting a 200 + `parseError` rather than a 500.

### Database (Drizzle + postgres-js)

- `src/db/index.ts` exposes `db` via a **lazy Proxy singleton**. The real connection is created on first property access, not at module load. This is required because Next.js build-time evaluation happens without env vars — do not "simplify" it to eager initialization or the Vercel build will break.
- `src/db/schema.ts` defines 8 tables: `tenants`, `users`, `templates`, `projects`, `assets`, `revisions`, `exports` (exported as `exports_` to avoid ES reserved-word collision), `consumption_logs`. On `projects`, `tenantId` and `templateId` are **nullable by design** (see IP phase above) — do not add `.notNull()` to them.
- `src/db/init-sql.ts` contains raw `CREATE TABLE` DDL used by `/api/admin/init`. Drizzle migrations are **not** in use; schema changes require updating both `schema.ts` and `init-sql.ts` together (plus a manual ALTER if data exists in production). The `drizzle/` directory exists but is empty.
- `src/db/seed-data.ts` holds the canonical 7 tenants + 13 templates. `slug` is the idempotency key.

### `publicId` generation

Two code paths, both count existing rows matching a LIKE prefix and append a zero-padded sequence:

- **IP mode** (POST `/api/projects` without `tenantSlug`/`templateSlug`): `IP-<year>-<NNNN>`.
- **MP mode** (POST with both, or PATCH handoff): `<TENANT_UPPER>-<TEMPLATE_PREFIX>-<year>-<NNNN>`, where `TEMPLATE_PREFIX` comes from `templates.idPrefix` (e.g. `RP` for Reportaje, `ASL` for Asesoría Legislativa).

This is racy under concurrent creates but acceptable for the current volume (6-8 projects/month per the project docs). Don't refactor it into a sequence unless that volume assumption changes.

### Frontend layout (App Router)

- `src/app/page.tsx` — operator dashboard (status of DB, tenants, templates, IA calls).
- `src/app/projects/` — list, new, and `[id]/ProjectDetailClient.tsx` (the large client component that drives pipeline transitions and the IP→MP handoff UI).
- `src/app/tools/angulos/` — standalone tool UI for Generador de Ángulos; newer tools should use the same page + `*Client.tsx` split.
- `src/components/Nav.tsx` — top nav.
- Path alias `@/*` maps to `src/*` (see `tsconfig.json`).

## Branding rules (enforced in prompts and outputs)

From `doc/IP_MP_ESTADO_MAESTRO.md`:

- Tenant `codigo-maestro-soberano`: **never** mention "Ignacio" in any generated output. Treat as a methodology, not a personal legacy.
- Template `asesoria-legislativa`: every normative/legal reference must be marked `[VERIFICAR]`. A human verification step is mandatory before export.
- AI-generated imagery must be declared as such in metadata/credits and must not represent real people.
- The API key never appears in frontend code, chat, or commits.

## Deployment workflow

The operator does not write code — Claude produces full files, the operator drops them into `C:\ipmp-platform\`, runs `npm run build` locally to catch errors, then `git push`. Vercel auto-deploys main. Keep this in mind when structuring changes: prefer small, self-contained file replacements over multi-file refactors that require ordering.

Environment is Windows + bash (Git Bash / WSL-style). Use Unix paths and forward slashes in scripts; avoid PowerShell-only idioms unless the operator explicitly asks.
